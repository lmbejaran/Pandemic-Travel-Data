Title:
Trips by Distance
Summary:
The data describes travel behaviour of people in the US in states when they take trips away from home in 2019 and 2020. Trips are defined as movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home. Home locations are imputed on a weekly basis. A movement with multiple stays of longer than 10 minutes before returning home is counted as multiple trips. Trips capture travel by all modes of transportation. including driving, rail, transit, and air.
The dataset includes 1,97M rows and 19 columns
Columns include:
Level, Date, State Postal Code, County FIPS, County Name
Population Staying at Home, not staying at home
Number of trips (between 0 and 500)
Sample questions we can ask of the data and visualize:
-How far and for how do people travel from home on average, by state, by month
-Where do people take the longest trips (in time and/or distance)
-Which states have the most “mobile” residents
-What are the differences between 2019 and 2020
-etc.
